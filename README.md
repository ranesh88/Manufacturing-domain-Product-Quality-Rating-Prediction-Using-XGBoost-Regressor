# Manufacturing-domain-Product-Quality-Rating-Prediction-Using-XGBoost-Regressor
Manufacturing is one of the main application of Data Science. It helps to optimize processes, predicts maintenance needs, and enhances product quality through advanced analytics and machine learning. It utilizes data to drive efficiency, quality, and innovation in production, supply chain management, and decision-making.

In this project, we implements the XGBoost Regressor for Quality Rating Prediction.

The objective of the project below mentioned ::

1. Predictive Maintenance
2. Quality Control
3. Supply Chain Optimization
4. Process Optimization
5. Demand Forecasting
