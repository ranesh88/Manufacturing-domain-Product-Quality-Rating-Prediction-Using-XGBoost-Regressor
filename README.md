# Manufacturing-domain-Product-Quality-Rating-Prediction-Using-XGBoost-Regressor
Manufacturing is one of the main application of Data Science. It helps to optimize processes, predicts maintenance needs, and enhances product quality through advanced analytics and machine learning. It utilizes data to drive efficiency, quality, and innovation in production, supply chain management, and decision-making.

In this project, we implements the XGBoost Regressor for Quality Rating Prediction.

The objective of the project below mentioned ::

1. Predictive Maintenance
2. Quality Control
3. Supply Chain Optimization
4. Process Optimization
5. Demand Forecasting

This manufacturing dataset consists of the following columns:

1.	Temperature (Â°C): This column represents the temperature during the manufacturing process, 
#measured in degrees Celsius. Temperature plays a critical role in many manufacturing processes, 
influencing material properties and product quality.

2.	Pressure (kPa): The pressure applied during the manufacturing process, measured in kilopascals (kPa). 
#Pressure can affect the material transformation and the overall outcome of the manufacturing process.

3.	Temperature x Pressure: This feature is an interaction term between temperature and pressure,
#which captures the combined effect of these two process parameters.

4.	Material Fusion Metric: A derived metric calculated as the sum of the square of temperature and the cube of pressure.
It represents a material fusion-related measurement during the manufacturing process.

5.	Material Transformation Metric: Another derived metric calculated as the cube of temperature minus the square of pressure.
#It provides insight into material transformation dynamics.

6.	Quality Rating: The target variable, 'Quality Rating,' represents the overall quality rating of the produced items. 
#Quality is a crucial aspect of manufacturing, and this rating serves as a measure of the final product's quality.

XGBoost, or eXtreme Gradient Boosting, is a machine learning algorithm that belongs to the family of gradient boosting methods. for both classification and regression tasks.
XGBoost works by building a series of decision trees sequentially, each one correcting the errors of the previous tree, thereby improving predictive accuracy. It's widely used in various domains such as finance, healthcare, and online advertising due to its effectiveness in handling structured/tabular data and its ability to handle large datasets efficiently.

Key components of XGBoost:

-Boosting Technique:  XGBoost is an ensemble learning method that combines the predictions of multiple weak learners (usually decision trees) to create a strong predictive model.

-Objective Function: 
XGBoost uses a regularized objective function that consists of two parts: a loss function that measures the model's prediction error and a regularization term that helps prevent overfitting.

-Gradient Boosting: 
During training, the algorithm starts with a simple model and iteratively adds decision trees to the ensemble. Each tree is fitted to the residuals (the differences between the predicted and actual values) of the previous trees in the ensemble. The learning process involves minimizing the overall objective function by adjusting the weights of the weak learners.

-Tree Pruning:  
XGBoost incorporates tree pruning techniques to control the growth of individual trees, preventing them from becoming too deep and reducing the risk of overfitting.

-Regularization:
XGBoost includes L1 (Lasso) and L2 (Ridge) regularization terms in its objective function to penalize complex models and prevent overfitting.Regularization helps in feature selection and improves the model's generalization capabilities.

-Parallel Processing and Optimization: XGBoost is designed for speed and efficiency, with features such as parallel processing to handle large datasets and optimize training times.It supports hardware acceleration, making it suitable for both CPU and GPU processing.

-Feature Importance:  XGBoost provides a feature importance score, indicating the contribution of each feature to the model's predictions. This is valuable for understanding the model's behavior and identifying influential features.
